# POML Go Porting Project

This document outlines the goals and structure of the Go port for the POML template engine.

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to create a Go implementation of the POML template engine that is compatible with the existing Python and JS/TS implementations.

The Go port should:
- Parse and render `.poml` files.
- Support the full POML language specification, including the template engine features.
- Provide a simple and intuitive API for developers.
- Be well-documented and easy to use.

## Project Structure

The project will be structured as follows:

- `_docs`: Contains the documentation for the project, including this file.
- `src`: Will contain the Go source code for the POML engine.
- `examples`: Will contain example `.poml` files and Go programs demonstrating how to use the engine.
- `tests`: Will contain the test suite for the Go implementation.
